You should produce a final project report. That report must include the final version of your projectâ€™s: 

functional/nonfunctional requirements table 

at least the UML sequence, activity and class diagrams

system architecture diagrams. 

The report should describe and support your design, specification and implementation choices, outlining how you integrated principles of dependability, project management and advanced software engineering into your project. Finally, the report should contain a description of your testing and evaluation processes.

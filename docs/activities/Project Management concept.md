While designing any system project, management is required and our team followed the following project management activities:

1. Project planning: We started our project by first studying the problem statement thoroughly and identifying the requirements in the problem statement. We decided to deliver the designed system in three iterations and each in each iteration we ensured new functionality was added. The progress of each individual was tracked by weekly team meetings.

2. People management: The project was divided into different sections and each individual was assigned the task based on his/her knowledge on the subject. We ensured that each team members are on the same page by sharing the knowledge with each other. This ensured that there was timely progress and the system was delivered on time.

> Incorporate at least one dependable attribute

Dependable attributes are the qualities of a system and has the ability to provide services that can be trusted. Medical appointment system is a critical system and should be available 24 x 7 to the user, while designing this system our aim was to provide efficient appropriate doctor according to the patient's  illness. 

When discussing the dependable attribute the first attribute that was taken into consideration by our team was "Availability" i.e. the system is available (Does not crash) even though there is increase in the no of users on the system, we have achieved this by making system more scalable, we have used container based deployment model that ensures that system handles the load of increased user.

Next attribute that was taken into consideration was "Reliability", the database designed by our team is integrated in way which ensures that only registered users can use the services provided by the system. This is done by assigned UUID to each registered user and this UUID is used to access the appointments in the system, so if in case a person who is not registered, randomly enters hsi/her details, the system will immediately flag the user as invalid.

The last attribute taken into consideration was "Security", we have ensured that the data entered by the user is well secured in the database and the password entered by the user hashed.

> Incorporate at least one Project Management concept

While designing any system project, management is required and our team followed the following project management activities:

1. Project planning: We started our project by first studying the problem statement thoroughly and identifying the requirements in the problem statement. We decided to deliver the designed system in three iterations and each in each iteration we ensured new functionality was added. The progress of each individual was tracked by weekly team meetings.

2.People management: The project was divided into different sections and each individual was assigned the task based on his/her knowledge on the subject. We ensured that each team members are on the same page by sharing the knowledge with each other. This ensured that there was timely progress and the system was delivered on time.

# Specification explanation
The above diagram is a pictorial representation of how we are calculating available slots.

### Pseudo form
1. The total slots are generated from a work shift. This shift is generated by a registered 
 specified range of hours. We generate hours from that range
2. Next step is to remove all the hours which are not available for several differen reasons.
   1. Lunch Hour - The defined fixed hour 
   2. Booked Schedule Hours - The hours which are already booked in some other appointment
   3. Reserved Slots for priority booking - The slots which are available for booking for prior patients. 
      They are free for booking once 7 days passes.
   4. Available slots joined with Doctor_info, specialization, illness mapping - This part filters the doctor for specialization and illness category which are arguments 
    passed from the app.

# Project Management

While designing any system, project management is required and our team followed the following project management activities:

1. **Project planning:** We started our project by first studying the problem statement thoroughly and identifying the requirements in the problem statement. We decided to deliver the designed system in three iterations and each in each iteration we ensured new functionality was added. The progress of each individual was tracked by weekly team meetings.
2. **People management:** The project was divided into different sections and each individual was assigned the task based on his/her knowledge on the subject. We ensured that each team members are on the same page by sharing the knowledge with each other. This ensured that there was timely progress and the system was delivered on time.
3. **Risk management:** The following critical risks were indentified for this project.

Risk | Description | Impact | Probability | Severity | Mitigation Strategy
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |---
Requirements change | More changes to the requirements than planned for. | Project delivery timeline is slowed. | Low: requirements are agreed upon and specified early. | Serious | Specify and agree upon requirements at beginning of project to avoid delays later.
Size underestimate | Project size is underestimaed. | More time is needed for completion. | Moderate: size is usually agreed upon early. | Tolerable | Perform project planning to set a defined schedule and recalculate size throughout development.
Group member loss | A critical group member becomes unavailable. | Project delivery timeline is slowed | High: people have various schedules and are often unpredictable | Catastrophic | Incorporate a plan and hold team members accountable. Hold frequent meetings to keep participants engaged and monitor the progress of assignments.
4. **Proposal writing:** After receiving the problem statement the first thing we did was to write a proposal, in this we stated our objective and how do we plan to work on the project. It also included what softwares and programming languages we will be using , since this was just a team project for the subject we did not calculate cost and delivery estimates.

# Gantt Chart

We used the Gantt chart to track the overall progress of our project. This helped in organizing our sprints and track our missed targets during sprints and iterations. Placed below is the Gantt chart used by the team.

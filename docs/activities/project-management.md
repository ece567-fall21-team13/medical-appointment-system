# Project Management

While designing any system, project management is required and our team followed the following project management activities:

1. **Project planning:** We started our project by first studying the problem statement thoroughly and identifying the requirements in the problem statement. We decided to deliver the designed system in three iterations and each in each iteration we ensured new functionality was added. The progress of each individual was tracked by weekly team meetings.
2. **People management:** The project was divided into different sections and each individual was assigned the task based on his/her knowledge on the subject. We ensured that each team members are on the same page by sharing the knowledge with each other. This ensured that there was timely progress and the system was delivered on time.
3. **Risk management:** After identifying the functional and non-functional requirements, next thing we took into consideration was the risks that could affect the funcationality of the system. First risk identified by us was system availability, since this system was critical it should be available to the patients 24x7, thus we designed our system such that it is scalable as in it can handle increasing number of user and has low downtime. Second risk identified by us was that if the patient is not able to get the appointmnet within 14 days of request, in this case we decided to manually intervene the process and book an appointmnet for the patient (This is like the worst case scenario for the system).
4. **Proposal writing:** After receiving the problem statement the first thing we did was to write a proposal, in this we stated our objective and how do we plan to work on the project. It also included what softwares and programming languages we will be using , since this was just a team project for the subject we did not calculate cost and delivery estimates.

# Gantt Chart

We used the Gantt chart to track the overall progress of our project. This helped in organizing our sprints and track our missed targets during sprints and iterations.

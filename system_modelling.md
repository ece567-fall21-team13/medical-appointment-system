System Modeling

This process entails development of abstract models of a system that helps present different perspectives of the system. In our case, we will present different models that represent the medical appointment system in a graphicaal notation based on UML. Some of the prespectives that are represented by various models explain: -

* External Perspective - It helps model the system environment. A context diagram placed below indicates different parts of the system that are being developed. Teh figure shows the medical appointment system where the appoitment scheduling system is connected to doctor management system, patient management system and an admin/ system manager system.

  Context diagram and explaination .........


* Interaction Perspective - This helps model the interactions between a system and its environment/ componenets of the system. This helps in identification of potential communication problems. Our case explains this perspective through the Use case and the sequence model for teh appoitment scheduling system.

* Structural perspective - The system organisation and the structure of the data processing is modeled here. Our case study explains this via class diagrams. Various objects that represented in the system are doctor, patient, calender based scheduler, admin login system. The class diagram is plcaed below. Explain the class diagram .......



* Behavioral perspective - Here we model the dynamic behavior of the system abd how it responds to events.  A state diagram and a DFD is placed below to explain the behavioral perspective of medical appointment system. The scheduling data of the doctor and the patient generate the stimuli that triggers the system processing.
